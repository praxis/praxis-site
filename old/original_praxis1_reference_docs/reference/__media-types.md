title: Media Types
---

Media types provide the structural representations of the API resources we want to expose. They also commonly have a name, as provided by their identifier. Note that the structure of a MediaType does imply any particular encoding (JSON vs XML...). For example, let's say we want to expose Users in our API. In this case, a simple MediaType for users could be define by a structure containing an `id`, `name` and `email`, and be represented by the following identifier `application/vnd.mycompany.users`. This means that if we issue an API to retrieve a user, we will probably get back a response with `Content-Type: application/vnd.mycompany.users+json`, which indicates 2 different things. The first one indicates what type of attribute structure the payload contains (i.e., `id`, `name` and `email` fields). The second one (denoted by the `+json` suffix) indicates that the structure is encoded in JSON. Praxis Media-Types are concerned only with the design aspects only (i.e., structure), and leaves any encoding concerns to the implementation part.

So, to define a media type for an API resource, we simply create a class that derives from `Praxis::MediaType`, where we can define its structure within the `attributes` section and give it a unique identifier name. A media type can also have a human-readable description, which will show up in any generated documentation.

Here's an example of a simple media type that describes a few attributes for a
hypothetical Blog API resource. It also defines a couple of views for it, one
called `default`, which displays the common attributes of a Blog, and another
called `link` which only includes the `href` attribute, and can be
used when rendering links to Blogs.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Blog < Praxis::MediaType
  description 'A Blog API resource represents...'
  identifier 'application/vnd.acme.blog'

  attributes do
    attribute :id, Integer
    attribute :href, String
    attribute :owner, Person
    attribute :subject, String
    attribute :locale do
      attribute :language, String
      attribute :country, String
    end
  end
  
end
{% endhighlight %}

DEFAULT FIELDSET??

Once a media type is defined within your application, you can use it to wrap a
compatible data object holding resource data, and render it using any of the
available views. A compatible object must respond to the method names matching
the media type attribute names, and return sub-objects that are compatible with
the types defined in the media type. Praxis renders media types into `Hash`
structures to achieve format-independence.  These rendered hash structures can
be formatted in your application using the desired wire encoding (JSON, XML, or
any other type you might need).

Here are two examples of how to render a blog_object using the `Blog` media
type: one using its `default` view and another using its `link` view:

{% highlight ruby %}
Blog.render(blog_object, view: :default)
=> {
 'id' : 123,
 'owner' : { ...an owner hash rendered with its :compact view...},
 'subject' : 'First post',
 'locale' : { 'language': 'en', 'country': 'us' }
}


Blog.render(blog_object, view: :link)
=> { 'href' : '/blogs/123' }
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, your `blog_object` must return:

{% highlight bash %}
+---------+---------------------------------------------+
| Method  | Return value                                |
|---------+---------------------------------------------|
| id      | integer                                     |
| owner   | object compatible with a Person media type  |
| subject | String                                      |
| locale  | object compatible with the locale structure |
| href    | String                                      |
+---------+---------------------------------------------+
{% endhighlight %}

Praxis provides a lot of help in managing resource objects and linking them to
data sources (including databases) by integrating with the
[Praxis::Mapper](https://rubygems.org/gems/praxis-mapper) gem.

Also, Praxis allows you to generate compatible objects using the `.example`
feature of MediaType classes. Using this `.example` feature you can create
random instances of compatible objects without any extra effort, which is great
to simulate returning data objects when testing controller responses without
requiring any data source access. There is also some help available for
creating realistic examples for your test cases. See more [examples](#examples)
at the end of this document.

## Description

You can specify a description for the media type using the `description`
method. This description string is just for human consumption and is simply inserted directly into to the generated API documentation. However, the documentation browser will appropriately render any markdown or HTML tags that it contains.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Blog < Praxis::MediaType
  description <<-eos
    This is a sample blog.
    Which requires a much longer an elaborate description to be written.
  eos
end
{% endhighlight %}

## Identifier

The media type identifier method allows you to associate an Internet media type
string with the MediaType definition. Internet media types can be very general
like 'application/json' or specific like 'application/vnd.acme.blog':

{% highlight ruby %}
class Blog < Praxis::MediaType
  identifier 'application/vnd.acme.blog'
end
{% endhighlight %}

Identifiers have an optional suffix that indicates the encoding format used to represent the media;
for instance, a blog could be represented as an `application/vnd.acme.blog+json` or a `+xml`
without changing its essential blog-ness. Identifiers can also have semicolon-delimited options
such as `text/html; charset=utf-8`..

In Praxis, media type identifiers are represented by the `MediaTypeIdentifier` class which parses
the identifier's components and makes them available as instance accessors: `type`, `subtype`,
`suffix` and `parameters`. Identifier objects can be compared, modified, fuzzy-matched against
broader or narrower types, and transformed back into strings.

{% highlight ruby %}
MediaTypeIdentifier.load('text/plain; charset=utf-8').parameters['charset'] # => "utf-8"
MediaTypeIdentifier.load('image/*').match('image/jpeg') # => true
{% endhighlight %}

*NOTE*: In Praxis 1.0, the `MediaType#identifier` DSL method will return a `MediaTypeIdentifier`
object and not a String, but it will continue to accept either type of object as a parameter. To
future-proof your Praxis application, simply call `to_s` on the return value whenever you call
`MediaType#identifier`.

## Attributes

The attributes section of the media type describes the full structure of the
resource representation. It describes the superset of all possible attributes
that can appear in any view that can be rendered.

The `attributes` method expects a block of attribute definitions:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Blog < Praxis::MediaType
  attributes do
    attribute :id, Integer
    attribute :href, String,        regexp: %r{/blogs/\d+}
    attribute :owner, Person,       description: 'Owner of this Blog'
    attribute :subject, String
    attribute :created_at, DateTime
    attribute :visibility, String,  values: ['public','private']
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Each attribute has a name, type, description and other specific configuration
options: allowed values, format, examples, etc. While some options, such as
`description` and `values` are always available for any attribute, different
attribute types support type-specific options: `min`/`max` values for Integers,
`regexp` for Strings, etc. 

Similarly to the overall MediaType description, the documentation browser will render attribute `description` values as markdown or HTML as appropriate.

To read more about supported types and defining a complex and rich structures,
take a look at the [Attributor](https://rubygems.org/gems/attributor) gem and
other Praxis media type examples.

## View

A view describes which of the media type attributes should be exposed when that
view is rendered.

Each view has a unique name, and there can be as many views in a media type as
you like. Defining a view requires a block that lists the attribute names it
should include. Each included attribute can also take an optional parameter
that defines the view name to use when rendering that specific attribute. A
view option is only available when the type of the attribute is a MediaType
itself. If no view is specified, a view named `default` is used. Non-MediaType
attributes don't support views, so Praxis just renders them by calling `dump`.


{% highlight ruby %}
class Blog < Praxis::MediaType
  attributes do
    attribute :id, Integer
    attribute :href, String
    attribute :owner, Person
    attribute :subject, String
    attribute :created_at, DateTime
    attribute :locale do
      attribute :language, String
      attribute :country, String
    end
    attribute :blog_entries, Attributor::Collection.of(BlogEntry)
  end

  view :default do
    attribute :id
    attribute :owner
    attribute :locale
  end

  view :full do
    attribute :id
    attribute :owner, view: :expanded
    attribute :subject
    attribute :created_at
    attribute :blog_entries
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

The `full` view above will render all its attributes using their `default`
views, except the `owner` attribute, which will be rendered using an
`expanded` view. In order for this to work, the Person media type needs to have
an `expanded` view defined, detailing what attributes to include.

As a corollary, all media types should include a `default` view, as this is the
default view used for rendering.

To include an attribute that has sub-attributes in a view, it is enough to list
its top level name. All of its sub-attributes will follow. For example, the
above `default` view includes the `locale` attribute, which will cause its
`language` and `country` sub-attributes to be rendered.

By default, a view will not render attributes whose values are `nil`. This can be overrided by passing `include_nil: true` when defining the view. For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Blog < Praxis::MediaType
  view :partial, include_nil: true do
    # ...
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}


## Links

Praxis provides a special helper for crafting media types that refer to other
resources. In particular, it allows the use of the special `links` DSL within
the attributes block, where you can list related references. For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Blog < Praxis::MediaType
  identifier 'application/json'

  attributes do
    attribute :id, Integer
    attribute :href, String
    attribute :owner, Person
    attribute :subject, String
    attribute :created_at, DateTime
    attribute :blog_entries, Attributor::Collection.of(BlogEntry)

    links do
      link :owner
      link :blog_entries
    end
  end

  view :default do
    attribute :id
    attribute :subject
    attribute :links
  end

  view :full do
    attribute :id
    attribute :owner
    attribute :subject
    atttibute :blog_entries
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

The main difference between the top-level attributes and the attributes within
the `links` block is that when Praxis renders the views, it will default to
using the `link` view. That is, instead of using the `default` view when no
view specified, it will render the target attribute using its `link` view. For
this to work, the attribute must be a media type itself, and must define a
`link` view.

You can think about the "links" DSL as a way to:

- group links within a 'links' substructure
- automatically render their elements using the `link` view

### Embedding vs. linking

Rendering a Blog media type using the `full` view defined above, will result in
embedding two fully rendered media types plus all the other regular attributes
like `id`, `subject`. The `owner` attribute embeds a Person media type
rendered using its `default` view, and the `blog_entries` attribute embeds an
array of BlogEntries, each of them rendered with the `default` view. The goal
of providing the `full` view is that it directly embeds the whole
representation of related resources. This is the snippet of how the `full`
rendered view will look:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  id: 1
  subject: 'This is the Subject'
  owner: { ...a big owner hash rendered with its :default view...},
  blog_entries: [
    { id: 1, blog_text: 'This is the start of my first blog...' , owner: { ...} },
    { id: 2, blog_text: 'This is my second blog entry...', owner: { ...} }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Sometimes it is convenient to provide a lot of embedded information in an API
response as in the example above. This could save the client extra API calls to
retrieve that information later on. But in practice, you don't want to include
too much unnecessary information in your responses. So it is pretty common to
include only links to embedded information instead. This is exactly what
including `links` in your view will do for you.

This is what the Blog's `default` view renders:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  id: 1
  subject: 'This is the Subject'
  links: {
    blog_entries: [
      { href: '/blog_entries/1' },
      { href: '/blog_entries/2' }
    ],
    owner: { href: '/people/3' }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Rendering the `default` view for a Blog does not include the `owner` or
`blog_entries` as top level attributes. Instead, the `default` view includes
them inside the `links` attribute. So they will both be rendered using their
`link` views, which by convention will include a small subset of attributes,
perhaps just the href attribute like the example above. While this works well
for single related members, returning an array of objects with one `href` each
is not exactly what you might want for related collections. What you typically
want is to return a single collection href that, if followed, can provide the
contents of the related collection. In the next sections, we'll cover this in
more detail.

### Customizing links

So far, our examples have only shown that the `link` DSL takes a name attribute
which should match an existing and previously-defined attribute. But there are
three different ways to use the `link` stanza:

* Provide the name of an existing top-level attribute, like in the examples
  above. Using this method, there is no need to specify which associated media
  type the link will point to because that can be inferred from the top level
  attribute's type: `link :owner` will use the `Person` type.
* Explicitly include both the relationship name as well as
  the target MediaType to use. This allows you to link to a related resource,
  which might not be listed in the top-level attributes (or one that exists,
  but for which you want to use a custom MediaType instead): `link
  :latest_entry, BlogEntry` when there is no `:latest_entry` attribute defined
* Include a `using` option to tell Praxis which method name to use to retrieve
  the data for the link (see the next section for details): `link :super,
  Person, using: :manager` which uses the `manager` method rather than the
  `super` method

### Defining a link with the `using` option

When rendering an attribute, a media type retrieves the value from its
underlying object by calling a method of the same name on that object.  For
example, when rendering the `owner` attribute, the system will call the
`owner` method on the underlying object to retrieve the raw data.

There are cases, however, in which the name of the link relationship does not
necessarily correspond to the existing object's methods. There are other cases
in which you may want to use a relationship name that cannot be easily used as
a Ruby method. In this case, you can use the `using` modifier in the `link` DSL
to specify the name of the method to call instead.

Suppose that in the Blogs media type definition example, you want to get the
href for the owner, but you want to call it 'blogger' instead of 'owner'.
You can do this via the `using` clause:

{% highlight ruby %}
links do
  link :blogger, Person, using: :owner
end
{% endhighlight %}

This results in links that look like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  links: {
    blogger: { href: '/people/123' }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note: Technically speaking, the `using` modifier refers to the method name of
the object that the MediaType wraps, not a method of the MediaType instance.
In the example above, `using: :owner` only works because we know that the
underlying object has that method available.  If that method were not available
it would never be able to render its `owner` attribute. We could have used
`using: :foobar` in the example above, as long as the underlying data object
responds to `foobar`.

## Collections

Praxis media types can declare attributes that are ordered collections of other
media types or other Attributor types.

### Praxis::Collection

`Praxis::Collection.of(media_type)` defines an inner `Attributor::Collection.of(<media_type>)` type inside `media_type` (i.e., `Post::Collection`) that also includes the `Praxis::MediaTypeCommon` module. By default, Praxis will take the identifier of `<media_type>` and append a "collection=true" suffix to it. (*Note*: Previously, `Praxis::Collection.of` supported types that did not derive from `MediaType`. This usage has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use `Attributor::Collection.of` directly instead.)

For example, your blog media type might have an attribute that is a collection of posts:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Blog < Praxis::MediaType
  attributes do
    attribute :id, Integer
    attribute :posts, Praxis::Collection.of(Post)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

When parsing the :posts definition above, Praxis will resolve the type by looking if a `Post::Collection` class already exists. If it does, it will be used as the type for the `:posts` attribute, otherwise one will be created. One can think of `Praxis::Collection.of(Post)` to be equivalent to `Post::Collection`, except that it will create one if it does not exist already. 

As stated above, the created inner `Collection` class will simply be an `Attributor::Collection` that wraps members of a given MediaType, and that has an identifier that matches the member's identifier, with an added "collection=true" suffix. So in the above case, the `Post::Collection` will have an identifier of "application/vnd.acme.post;collection=true".

This inner `Collection` should be sufficient in most cases. However, you can explicitly define your own and Praxis will use that instead. Here's an example of how to do that if you wanted `Post::Collection` to have an identifier of "application/vnd.acme.posts" instead:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Post < Praxis::MediaType
  identifier 'application/vnd.acme.post'
  # ...

  class Collection < Attributor::Collection
    member_type Post
    identifier 'application/vnd.acme.posts'
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Note: When defined without using the `.of` helper, you use the `member_type` method to specify what type of media type class this collection is wrapping. If you want a non-anonymous class that is a collection and also has other attributes (such as description), you have two ways to define it:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Option 1: implicit collection type; reopen class to add more information
CommentThread = Praxis::Collection.of(Comment)
class CommentThread
  description 'A sequence of comments on a blog post.'
end

# Option 2: explicit collection type with member_type specified inline
class CommentThread < Praxis::Collection
  member_type Comment
  description 'A sequence of comments on a blog post.'
end
{% endhighlight %}

### Attributor::Collection

An Attributor::Collection is a way to embed a collection of another Attributor
type. For example, you may want a collection of tag strings to be an attribute
of your blog media type:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Blog < Praxis::MediaType
  attributes do
    attribute :id, Integer
    attribute :tags, Attributor::Collection.of(String)
  end

  view :default do
    attribute :id
    attribute :tags
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Praxis expects to find a method named `tags` on the underlying object which
must return an array of strings. And when you render this media type, Praxis
will render them as an array of Strings.

Read more about Attributor and Attributor collections in the [attributor README
file](https://github.com/rightscale/attributor/blob/master/README.md).


### Linking to Collections

Because collections are simply arrays of objects, they will not have attributes nor views of their own, which means the normal assumptions for defining and rendering links can not apply. Instead, you should define an inner `MediaType` (or `Praxis::Blueprint`) with the attributes and views you need, and use that for your links.

For example, you might define a `Post::CollectionSummary` type for use in links to groupings of `Post`s:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Post < Praxis::MediaType
  # ...  

  class CollectionSummary < Praxis::Blueprint
    attributes do
      attribute :name, String
      attribute :size, Integer
      attribute :href, String
    end

    view :link do
      attribute :name
      attribute :size
      attribute :href
      end
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can use that from the `Blog` media type in the following way:
{% highlight ruby %}
class Blog < Praxis::MediaType
  attributes do
    attribute :posts_summary, Post::CollectionSummary
    links do
      link :posts, Post::CollectionSummary, using: :posts_summary
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}


### Praxis::MediaTypeCollection

*NOTE*: `Praxis::MediaTypeCollection` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Praxis. 

The documentation for it has been moved to [MediaTypeCollection](/reference/media-type-collections).


## Examples

Praxis provides tools to automatically generate example object values that will
respond to each and every attribute name of a media type and will return an
object that responds to the correct methods of their defined type, including
when the attribute type is another media type.

The values of the generated example attributes will also conform to
specifications like default values, regexp, etc.

Please see [Praxis::Mapper](https://rubygems.org/gems/praxis-mapper) and
[Attributor](https://rubygems.org/gems/attributor) for more on generating
example objects.
